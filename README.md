## Abstract
The proposed algorithm segments automatically white blood cell nuclei.  
This function works well with microscopic images, which have 3 types of cells: red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Only white blood cells possess nuclei.

## Implementation info
Implementation is based on this scientific paper: 
```
Mrs. Sonali C. Sonar, Prof. K. S. Bhagat 
"An Efficient Technique for White Blood Cells Nuclei Automatic Segmentation" 
```

## Message
The following codes are implemented only for PERSONAL USE, e.g improving programming skills in the domain of Image Processing and Computer Vision.  
If you use this algorithm, please cite the paper mentioned above to support the authors.
