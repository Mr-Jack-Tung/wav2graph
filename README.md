## Project Overview

In the **wav2graph** paper, we introduce the first framework for supervised learning knowledge graph from speech data. This repository provides the necessary scripts, configurations, and setup instructions to reproduce the experiments discussed in the paper.

## Setup

To set up the environment and run the experiments, follow the steps below:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Before you start, create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Hugging Face Token

You will need a Hugging Face API token to access certain resources used in this project. Insert your Hugging Face token into the relevant YAML configuration files.

### 3. Run the Experiments

Once the environment is set up and the configurations are complete, you can run the experiments using the provided script.

```bash
sh run.sh
```
